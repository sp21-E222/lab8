# lab8

In today's lab we'll be focussing on connecting your machine learning application with Flask and Docker to run your application as a service on a Docker container. 

## Task 1

Create your own repo

## Task 2

Follow the structure in lab 6 to get the necessary files needed for a minimum Flask application
```python
server.py
```
## Task 3

Make sure server.py can read your yaml file and remember what package allows us to do this.

## Task 4

Get the Dockerfile and other related files required to build and run your service in your container.

```bash
server.py
master.yaml
Dockerfile
Makefile
requirements.txt
```

## Task 5

Get your python code into your repo and writing definitions 

1. Create directory structure for your python code
    ```bash
    server.py
    master.yaml
    Dockerfile
    Makefile
    requirements.txt
    my_python_dir
    ```
2. Pickel your model

See the [Lab 6 notebook](https://github.com/sp21-E222/lab6/blob/main/svm_classifier.ipynb).

3. Create .py files with a prediciton definition

Create the prediction endpoint just like in lab 6
